# Understanding errors in mathematics.

I was given this prompt as an exercise:

```
Using linear approximation, determine the maximum absolute relative error for the function
f(x,y,z) = -(3*x**2*y**3)/sqrt(z) at (3,2,2) , assuming that the relative errors with respect to x , y  and z are at most 2.1 %, 0.5 % and 1.9 %, respectively. Give your answer as a percentage.
```
