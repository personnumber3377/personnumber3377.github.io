# Making an art generator

You can follow my journey here: https://github.com/personnumber3377/art_creator I discovered this guy while browsing brainrot youtube shorts: https://www.youtube.com/@Colescolor . Basically what he does is he spins paint buckets around a canvas and then claims that the result is somehow art. I was actually wondering if this style of "art" can be created programmatically. As it turns out, it can. If your art can be recreated with an automatic robot and that art is distinguishable from your own, then that probably means that your art is shit. AI art of course now exists, but usually it has that uncanny and plastic look to it, but these are 100% basically indistinguishable.

## Start of the program

Now, I am thinking if we should do this with pythons turtle library or render it using numpy or something else? I am going to like separate this into two parts. The first part is the simulation and then there is the frontend which is responsible for showing the drawing as it progresses.
