# Improving a google oss-fuzz harness.

Ok, so I was scrolling a hacking discord a bit and I noticed this:

![Google pays quite a lot](pictures/ossfuzz.png)

I decided to try my hand in improving some of the harnesses in oss-fuzz.

## Improving the fuzzing harness for tremor:

Ok, so after going through a couple of targets, I found one which seems quite outdated and which doesn't have a very impressive fuzzing harness: https://gitlab.xiph.org/xiph/tremor

Here is the current harness: (As of 24th of February 2024)

  const uint8_t *current;

  ov_callbacks memory_callbacks = {0};
  memory_callbacks.read_func = read_func;
  vorbis_data data_st;
  data_st.size = Size > INPUT_LIMIT ? INPUT_LIMIT : Size;
  data_st.current = Data;
  data_st.data = Data;
  OggVorbis_File vf;
  int result = ov_open_callbacks(&data_st, &vf, NULL, 0, memory_callbacks);
  if (result < 0) {
    return 0;
  }
  int current_section = 0;
  char pcm[4096];
  long read_result;
  while (true) {
    read_result = ov_read(&vf, pcm, sizeof(pcm), &current_section);
    if (read_result <= 0 && read_result != OV_HOLE) {
      break;
    }
  }
  ov_clear(&vf);
  return 0;
}

```

which is quite a decent harness.

After the painstaking process of creating a coverage report, here it is:

![](pictures/tremor_cov.png)

as we can see, we only have around 62 percent of the functions covered. There is quite a lot of space for improvement.

One thing which we can add is we can add coverage for the ov_comment function. Another thing which we can do is we can add support for the fuzzing of seekable files. This is because there are a lot of functions in there which need a seekable file in order to work. For example this:

```
     927          56 : static int _ov_open2(OggVorbis_File *vf){
     928          56 :   if(vf->ready_state != PARTOPEN) return OV_EINVAL;
     929          56 :   vf->ready_state=OPENED;
     930          56 :   if(vf->seekable){
     931           0 :     int ret=_open_seekable2(vf);
     932           0 :     if(ret){
     933           0 :       vf->datasource=NULL;
     934           0 :       ov_clear(vf);
     935             :     }
     936           0 :     return(ret);
     937             :   }else
     938          56 :     vf->ready_state=STREAMSET;
     939             : 
     940          56 :   return 0;
     941             : }
```

where the _open_seekable2 function only gets called if the file is seekable. and stdin is not seekable, therefore this is never called. So maybe we should add a method which takes in data from stdin, then writes it to a file and then reads that file. This causes the seekable condition to be true and therefore causes more coverage.

## Looking for another target.

Ok, so that library didn't really yield that good of results, so let's try to find a more better target.

Luckily for us, we can sort by language in oss-fuzz, because there is a yaml file which has a tag called language. Here we can see that if we can add a sanitizer and then find two bugs with it, then we are eligible for a payout: https://bughunters.google.com/about/rules/5097259337383936/oss-fuzz-reward-program-rules . If there isn't a sanitizer tag present, then the default sanitizers of address and undefined are used. (No MSAN, because it can cause problems) according to this: https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/blob/master/docs/getting-started/new_project_guide.md#sanitizers-optional-sanitizers

Ok, so there aren't any interesting looking projects which do not use some of the sanitizers. That sucks. Thanks for reading anyway!
