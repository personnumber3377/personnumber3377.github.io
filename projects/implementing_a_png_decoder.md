# Implementing a PNG decoder

This blog post is based on this another blog post: https://pyokagan.name/blog/2019-10-14-png/ . Feel free to follow along.

## Prerequisites

 - A zlib implementation

The PNG spec is just wrapper around the zlib compression algorithm and zlib is itself a wrapper around the DEFLATE algorithm. I actually implemented zlib myself here: https://personnumber3377.github.io/projects/implementing_zlib_decompress.html . It turned out alright in my opinion. During the development of the PNG reader, I am actually going to use that zlib decompressor which I implemented myself.

## Starting out

Ok, so as many file formats, the PNG file consists of different "blocks" each of which serve a distinct purpose. In addition, PNG files have a distinct file header to signify that they are PNG files:

```

PngSignature = b'\x89PNG\r\n\x1a\n'

```

Actually, I am just going to implement a file called "const.py" where I store all of the constants (as the name suggests).

Here is the beginnings of my code:

```


# Main PNG decoder entrypoint...

import sys
#import const
from const import * # Some constants
import struct # For reading binary data without having to worry about endianness etc etc..
import zlib # This is for zlib.crc32 only!

'''

SOME NOTES

Length	4-byte unsigned integer giving the number of bytes in the chunk's data field. The length counts only the data field, not itself, the chunk type, or the CRC. Zero is a valid length.
Chunk Type	A sequence of 4 bytes defining the chunk type.
Chunk Data	The data bytes appropriate to the chunk type, if any. This field can be of zero length.
CRC	A 4-byte CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Code) calculated on the preceding bytes in the chunk, including the chunk type field and the chunk data fields, but not including the length field. The CRC can be used to check for corruption of the data.

'''

def read_chunks(data: bytes) -> list: # Returns a list of the binary chunks.
	chunks = []
	while True: # While there are chunks to be read.
		chunk_header = data[:SIZEOF_CHUNK_HEADER] # Read the chunk header.
		print("chunk_header == "+str(chunk_header))
		print("len(chunk_header) == "+str(len(chunk_header)))
		data = data[SIZEOF_CHUNK_HEADER:] # Advance the data.
		chunk_length, chunk_type = struct.unpack('>I4s', chunk_header) # Decode the chunk header
		# Now read the chunk contents.
		chunk_data = data[:chunk_length]
		data = data[chunk_length:] # Advance the data.
		calculated_checksum = zlib.crc32(chunk_data, zlib.crc32(struct.pack('>4s', chunk_type))) # Calculate checksum.
		crc_bytes = data[:CHUNK_CRC_SIZE]
		data = data[CHUNK_CRC_SIZE:] # Advance data pointer.
		chunk_crc, = struct.unpack('>I', crc_bytes) # The expected CRC.
		if chunk_crc != calculated_checksum: # CRC mismatch, therefore data is corrupted!
			print("File is corrupted!")
			exit(1)
		chunks.append(tuple((chunk_data, chunk_type))) # Add the chunk and the chunk type to the list.
		print("chunk_type == "+str(chunk_type))
		if chunk_type == IEND_CHUNK_IDENTIFIER: # The last chunk. Break now.
			break
	return chunks

def read_png(data: bytes) -> None: # Just show as an image (for now).
	if data[:len(PNG_HEADER)] != PNG_HEADER: # Not a PNG file!
		print("File isn't a PNG file!")
		exit(1)
	data = data[len(PNG_HEADER):] # Skip the PNG header for reading the chunks
	chunks = read_chunks(data)
	# Get the chunk types as a list.
	chunk_types = [chunk[1] for chunk in chunks]
	# The very first chunk should be a b'IHDR' chunk.
	if chunk_types[0] != b'IHDR':
		print("Very first chunk should be a b'IHDR' chunk!")
		exit(1)
	return 0 # Return success

def main() -> int: # Main function
	# Read contents from the file supplied in argv[1]
	if len(sys.argv) < 2: # aka 1
		print("Usage: "+str(sys.argv[0])+" PNG_FILE")
		exit(1)
	filename = sys.argv[1]
	# Open file and read file as bytes
	fh = open(filename, "rb")
	data = fh.read()
	fh.close()
	# Now decode the data.
	read_png(data)
	return 0 # Return success


if __name__=="__main__":
	exit(main())


```

Basically, it is just code which loops over each chunk in the file and then adds all of the chunks to a list while reading.

Here is my code with some additional checks in-place:

```


# Main PNG decoder entrypoint...

import sys
#import const
from const import * # Some constants
import struct # For reading binary data without having to worry about endianness etc etc..
import zlib # This is for zlib.crc32 only!

## Interpreting the IHDR chunk:

Ok, so let's start with the header chunk. It should always be 13 bytes in length and it has well defined fields:










## Debugging the zlib library.

Ok, so as it turns out, there exists a bug in my zlib library and that causes shit to go haywire.

Here is the program output:

```

chunk_header == b'\x00\x00\x00\rIHDR'
len(chunk_header) == 8
chunk_type == b'IHDR'
chunk_header == b'\x00\x00\x00\x04gAMA'
len(chunk_header) == 8
chunk_type == b'gAMA'
chunk_header == b'\x00\x00\x00oIDAT'
len(chunk_header) == 8
chunk_type == b'IDAT'
chunk_header == b'\x00\x00\x00\x00IEND'
len(chunk_header) == 8
chunk_type == b'IEND'

```

we can see that it is a so called "dynamic" block, which makes sense, because I didn't actually do the stuff when programming the zlib library. I didn't add a test for the dynamic trees, because encoding simple strings with zlib.compress yields usually "static" blocks.

Let's take a look at the code from here: https://pyokagan.name/blog/2019-10-18-zlibinflate/ and see where our code fucks up.

Here is the reference implementation:

    def read_byte(self):
        self.numbits = 0 # discard unread bits
        b = self.mem[self.pos]
        self.pos += 1
        return b

    def read_bit(self):
        if self.numbits <= 0:
            self.b = self.read_byte()
            self.numbits = 8
        self.numbits -= 1
        # shift bit out of byte
        bit = self.b & 1
        self.b >>= 1
        return bit

    def read_bits(self, n):
        o = 0

```

my code produces this: `backwards_distance_extra_bits[symbol] == 4` while the reference implementation has this: `backwards_distance_extra_bits[symbol] == 0`

Actually, the problem here:

```

def lz77_decode_block(r: Bitreader, literal_length_tree: HuffmanTree, distance_tree: HuffmanTree, output: list) -> None: # The output is the list of bytes to output. This function modifies it in-place.
	while True: # Main decoding loop.

		if val < 256: # Literal value
			output.append(val)
		elif val == 256: # End of block
			return output # Return the final data
		else: # The value encodes the length portion.
			symbol = val - 257

			# Now read the extra bits. and add it to the baselength to get the final length
			final_length = r.read_n_bits(length_extra_bits[symbol]) + length_bases[symbol]
			# Now read the distance amount in a similar fashion
			distance_amount = distance_tree.read_symbol(r)
			print("backwards_distance_extra_bits[symbol] == "+str(backwards_distance_extra_bits[symbol]))
			print("backwards_distance_bases[symbol] == "+str(backwards_distance_bases[symbol]))
			final_distance = r.read_n_bits(backwards_distance_extra_bits[symbol]) + backwards_distance_bases[symbol]
			# Now we have the final <length, distance> pair decoded from the bitstream. add to the output.
			# Take advantage of pythons ability to access with negative indexes. Note that this works, because the index [-n] changes as we are appending to the list.
			print("final_length == "+str(final_length))
			print("final_distance == "+str(final_distance))
			for _ in range(final_length):
				#print("final_distance == "+str(final_distance))
				output.append(output[-1*final_distance])

	return output # Return the final byte list.
```

because I never actually use the `distance_amount` variable anywhere. I had quite a brain fart here and that caused shit to go wrong..

After fixing this function looks like this:

```
def lz77_decode_block(r: Bitreader, literal_length_tree: HuffmanTree, distance_tree: HuffmanTree, output: list) -> None: # The output is the list of bytes to output. This function modifies it in-place.

			symbol = val - 257
			print("length_bases[symbol] == "+str(length_bases[symbol]))
			print("length_extra_bits[symbol] == "+str(length_extra_bits[symbol]))
			# Now read the extra bits. and add it to the baselength to get the final length
			final_length = r.read_n_bits(length_extra_bits[symbol]) + length_bases[symbol]
			# Now read the distance amount in a similar fashion

```

After these fixes, my PNG data get's correctly decompressed! Good!

## Decoding the decompressed data

Ok, so now that we can extract the data from the scanlines. The very first byte signifies the so called "filter type". The blog post which I am following doesn't really shed that much light on these filter types and how they were chosen, but I am just going to take that as granted and implement them.

Here is my main decoding function:

```

def read_png(data: bytes) -> None: # Just show as an image (for now).
	if data[:len(PNG_HEADER)] != PNG_HEADER: # Not a PNG file!
		print("File isn't a PNG file!")
		exit(1)
	data = data[len(PNG_HEADER):] # Skip the PNG header for reading the chunks
	chunks = read_chunks(data)
	# Get the chunk types as a list.
	chunk_types = [chunk[1] for chunk in chunks]
	# The very first chunk should be a b'IHDR' chunk.
	#if chunk_types[0] != b'IHDR':
	#	print("Very first chunk should be a b'IHDR' chunk!")
	#	exit(1)
	assert chunk_types[0] == IHDR_CHUNK_IDENTIFIER # First chunk should be "IHDR"
	assert chunk_types[-1] == IEND_CHUNK_IDENTIFIER # Final chunk should be "IEND"
	assert IDAT_CHUNK_IDENTIFIER in chunk_types # There should be atleast one data chunk.

	# Now process the IHDR chunk:

	Width	4 bytes	4-byte unsigned integer. Gives the image dimensions in pixels. Zero is an invalid value.
	Height	4 bytes
	Bit depth	1 byte	A single-byte integer giving the number of bits per sample or per palette index (not per pixel). Only certain values are valid (see below).
	Color type	1 byte	A single-byte integer that defines the PNG image type. Valid values are 0 (grayscale), 2 (truecolor), 3 (indexed-color), 4 (greyscale with alpha) and 6 (truecolor with alpha).

	print("Here is the length of the data: "+str(len(decompressed_data)))

	import numpy as np
	plt.imshow(np.array(image_bytes).reshape((height, width, 4)))
	plt.show()

	print("[+] Done!")
	return 0 # Return success

```

and here are the helper functions:

```

# These are used in the different filters.

BYTES_PER_PIXEL = 4 # This is the hardcoded value for one byte RGBA images which is usually the case.

def Reconstruct_a(r,c,out,scanlines): # out is the current output array and scanlines are the.. ya know.. scanlines. :D
	# return Recon[r * stride + c - bytesPerPixel] if c >= bytesPerPixel else 0
	return out[r][c - BYTES_PER_PIXEL] if c >= BYTES_PER_PIXEL else 0 # "r * stride" is basically the current scanline and then the c is the current pixel thing.

def Reconstruct_b(r,c,out,scanlines):
	# return Recon[(r-1) * stride + c] if r > 0 else 0
	return out[r-1][c] if r > 0 else 0 # The same thing as the same pixel on the previous scanline.

def Reconstruct_c(r,c,out,scanlines):
	# return Recon[(r-1) * stride + c - bytesPerPixel] if r > 0 and c >= bytesPerPixel else 0
	return out[r-1][c - BYTES_PER_PIXEL] if r > 0 and c >= BYTES_PER_PIXEL else 0 #

def PaethPredictor(a,b,c): # This is just a spec defined function
	p = a + b - c
	pa = abs(p - a)
	pb = abs(p - b)
	pc = abs(p - c)
	if pa <= pb and pa <= pc:
		Pr = a
	elif pb <= pc:
		Pr = b
	else:
		Pr = c
	return Pr

```

and it seems to work fine.

Now when I run my program on the PNG picture, it works! Good!

## Adding support for other image formats (let's start with "colort == 2" first)

Ok, so now we have a working PNG decoder. The problem is that it only works for RGBA images with color depth of 8 bits. Let's try to implement other picture types too.

Let's implement the `colort == 2` case (the `Truecolor	2	8, 16	Each pixel is a R,G,B triple.` image type) .

I think the easiest way to do this is to just improve the read_png function and then when showing the image, check if it has the alpha channel or not and then render it based on that.

Here is my current code:

```



def read_png(data: bytes) -> None: # Just show as an image (for now).
	if data[:len(PNG_HEADER)] != PNG_HEADER: # Not a PNG file!
		print("File isn't a PNG file!")
		exit(1)

	global BYTES_PER_PIXEL # We may modify this when we read "colort" (the image type) . Up until then, this is assumed to be 4

	data = data[len(PNG_HEADER):] # Skip the PNG header for reading the chunks
	chunks = read_chunks(data)
	# Get the chunk types as a list.
	chunk_types = [chunk[1] for chunk in chunks]
	# The very first chunk should be a b'IHDR' chunk.
	#if chunk_types[0] != b'IHDR':
	#	print("Very first chunk should be a b'IHDR' chunk!")
	#	exit(1)
	assert chunk_types[0] == IHDR_CHUNK_IDENTIFIER # First chunk should be "IHDR"
	assert chunk_types[-1] == IEND_CHUNK_IDENTIFIER # Final chunk should be "IEND"
	assert IDAT_CHUNK_IDENTIFIER in chunk_types # There should be atleast one data chunk.

	# Now process the IHDR chunk:

```

the image which I am using is 640 pixels wide, so therefore what if we divide 2560 by that?

```
>>> 2560 / 640
4.0
```

What? That doesn't seem good. OOOooohhh, the bug is here: `scanline_size = 1 + width * 4 # Four bytes per pixel times the amount of pixels plus one, because the very first byte is the filter type.` . Let's replace that "4" with "BYTES_PER_PIXEL" and see what happens. After fixing this quick little bug. Now the thing works for both the `colort == 6` case and the `colort == 2` cases.

Supporting other bit depths other than 8 bits is quite difficult, because then the values aren't byte aligned, but let's worry about that later on. Actually, we do not need to worry about such cases, because if we look at the allowed bitdepths, we can see that the allowed bitdepths are all multiples of two, therefore we do not even need to try other cases, because we can just use some bit logic when reading.
