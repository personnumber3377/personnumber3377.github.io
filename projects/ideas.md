# Ideas

This is a compilation of some of my ideas, which I could do sometime.

- Basic interpreter in python (WIP)
- Write a time based fuzzer in python, which tries to find inputs, which timeout. (This could be useful for fuzzing different kinds of python applications for DOS vulns, like django etc).
