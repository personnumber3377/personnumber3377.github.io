# Fixing my radio kit

Ok so I bought this for around 10 euros: https://attach01.oss-us-west-1.aliyuncs.com/IC/DIY-Manual/GY20058.pdf

and now I have soldered it. When I try to turn it on, I only hear static, but if I put my ear very close, I can faintly hear some talking, so thankfully it works atleast on some level. Let's get to debugging.

## Verifying the components.

Now first I decided to follow the instructions again and verify that each part is in the correct spot and in the correct orientation. They seem to be.

## Did I fry the IC chip?

Now, because I am an electronics hobbyist beginner, I do not have an oscilloscope with which I could examine the waveforms, I resoldered the surface mounted IC chip and that could have damaged it.
